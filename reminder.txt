IMAGE CONTROLLER -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we have 2 fields - images and coverImage
IMAGES SHOULD COME FROM THESE 2 FIELDS ONLY. OTHERWISE IT THROWS ERROR
coverImage is 1 image and images is an array of images
to check for error in uploading images -
for "images" , if any image is not uploaded for some reason, the response will contain an "errors" field with file
name of images not uploaded
for "coverImage", if "coverImage" field does not exist in the response , it means the coverImage was not uploaded


** currently sending and storing only "public_id" and "version" of image in database
we have to dynamically create cloudinary url using these 2

Example url - https://res.cloudinary.com/dmuryuq0q/image/upload/f_auto,q_60/v1690790568/images/pg_image_Lk70UN2iGCSfQre.webp

IN THIS URL ->
dmuryuq0q                - cloudinary name (in .env file)
f_auto,q_60              - transformations that we apply*
v1690790568              - version
pg_image_Lk70UN2iGCSfQre - public_id

We can skip the transformations bcz we have already applied them using upload
we can use them if we want to apply some custom transformation on image before accessing it

** If ever want to store complete url in database -
add a field "url:String" in the "images" and "coverImage" field of pgSchema
In the "imageController.js", in "uploadToCloudinary" function,when sending success response, send url with it also,(just uncomment the line)
